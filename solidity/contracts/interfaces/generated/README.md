# Auto-Generated Interfaces

This directory contains auto-generated Solidity interfaces extracted from contract implementations.

## Generation

Interfaces are automatically generated by running:

```bash
yarn interface
```

This command:

1. Scans all `.sol` files in the `contracts/` directory
2. Extracts public/external functions, events, and errors
3. Generates corresponding interface files in this directory

## Notes

- These interfaces are auto-generated and should not be manually edited
- To regenerate interfaces after contract changes, run `yarn interface`
- The script skips:
  - Files already in the `interfaces/` directory
  - Files starting with `I` (assumed to be interfaces)
  - Test and mock contracts
  - Contracts with no public/external interface
